# lagacy-api-refactore

This project demonstrates the evolution of a Node.js application originally built using callback functions (Callback Hell) to an improved version utilizing async/await for better readability and maintenance. Additionally, Redis is implemented for caching data to enhance performance and reduce repeated database or API calls.

Features
Callback Hell Example: The initial version of the project uses nested callbacks to handle asynchronous tasks, demonstrating the challenges of Callback Hell.

Refactored Version: The code has been refactored to use async/await, making it more readable, maintainable, and easier to debug.

Redis Caching: Redis is integrated into the refactored version to cache the results of expensive operations, reducing the need for redundant data fetching and improving performance.

Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime used for the server-side code.

Async/Await: Refactored the code to use async/await for handling asynchronous operations.

Redis: In-memory data structure store used as a cache to improve performance.

node-fetch: A lightweight module to make HTTP requests.

Redis Client for Node.js: To interact with Redis in the refactored version.

This project benefited from the assistance of OpenAI's language model, which helped in refactoring the initial Callback Hell code to an improved version using async/await. The AI also provided guidance on integrating Redis for caching, helping to enhance the overall performance and efficiency of the application. It assisted in:

Refactoring nested callbacks into a more readable and maintainable async/await structure.

Suggesting the implementation of Redis caching for performance improvement.
